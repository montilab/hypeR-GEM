## What are genome-scale metabolic models(GEMs)?

Genome-scale metabolic models(GEMs) are curated metabolic models collect all known metabolic information of a biological system(e.g. human cell). There are three essential components in a GEM:

  -**metabolites**: all known metabolites of a biological system.
  -**reactions**: all known reactions of a biological system.
  -**protein(-coding) genes**

including the , **protein(-coding) genes**, **reactions**, and **metabolites**.

See [here](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2102344118) for more details.  


Here is a schematic diagram of a GEM:

The capital letters represent metabolites, and $r_i$ represents $i^{th}$ reaction. A prototypical reactions includes three parts:

  - **reactants(substrates)**: one or more metabolites that are consumed (left-hand side)
  - **products**:  one or more metabolites that are produced (right-hand side)
  - **catalyst**： protein(-coding) genes that catalyze the reaction

## Mapping workflow

To map a metabolite to its associated protein(-coding) genes, we define three types of associations:

  - **metabolite-reaction association**: A metabolite is associated with a reaction if:
    - The metabolite is either the reactant or the product of the reaction (**undirectional**)
    - The metabolite is is the product of the reaction (**directional**)
  
  - **reaction-protein(-coding) gene association**: A reaction is associated with protein(-coding) genes if these genes catalyze the reaction.
  
  - **metabolite-protein(-coding) gene association**: A metaboblite is associated with all protein(-coding) genes that catalyze the reactions associated with the metabolite.
